SOLID is a terminology in Software programming, which comprises of 5 main principles used in software development.
The first one of these is 'Single Responsibility Principle'.

It states that a module or a class should handle only one responsility i.e. the class should have responsibility of performing a single functionality and that single functionality should entirely be performed by the class. There should not be a separate module or class handling the same functionality.
